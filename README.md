Stuff on temples of the Classical world (Greek and Roman and Etruscan, etc)

## List of files

- README.md - This file.
- temple_bib.json: Bibliography in CSL JSON format on such temples from my [Zotero](https://zotero.org/) [library](https://www.zotero.org/john_muccigrosso/items). The bibliography contains citekeys which can be used in place of the full entry in other files and then converted by such things as pandoc.
