I will present an on-going project to develop a database of Roman temples (where "Roman" means "in Rome" and "in the Roman empire") that contains geographical and other data about these structures. While many such temples are included in existing databases, like Pleiades, others are not, and typically these other databases are more general purpose and so do not contain the detailed kinds of relevant information one might like to have (such as architectural style). As with other architectural forms, many questions about temples revolve around their geographical setting and orientation, so mapping the temples is an important part of our work.

The project grows out of my research interests in Roman temples and their location in the city of Rome, as well as my teaching needs. I am employed at a small liberal-arts college (SLAC) and teaching is not the only aspect of my work environment that has consequences for this project. Indeed the project first took shape last spring in the context of an university-wide effort to promote DH and to explore at how a SLAC could expand into this area. An undergraduate student has worked with me on the project over the summer as part of a Mellon Foundation-funded DH "Institute" that included several other faculty-led projects. The poster will therefore also address some of the challenges that arise from being at a SLAC (lack of research funding, graduate students, and technical-support staff).
