"679J6PNQ","thesis","1998","Muccigrosso, John D; Potter, David S.","Factional competition and monumental construction in mid-Republican Rome","","","","","http://search.proquest.com/docview/304443512","The late fourth and early third centuries B.C. witnessed important changes in the internal political structure of the Roman state as well as the rise of Rome to dominance of the Italian peninsula. At the same time, a number of different forms of public display became popular in the city, including temple foundations, building decoration and funerary games. In order to understand the relationship between these two phenomena, I undertake an examination of the ancient literary evidence for this period, emphasizing the survival of mid-Republican texts to later times. I then turn to the career of Appius Claudius Caecus, one of the major political figures of that time. Based on the results of this analysis, I apply a recently developed anthropological model of group activity, known as factionalism, to Agpius and the men associated with him in the sources. This model posits the existence of groups of men, bound together in order to achieve various personal political goals, and working within the existing political structure, though often engaged in innovative behavior which results in the evolution of their political system. In the case of Appius and his allies and opponents, factionalism is able to account for several of the activities of public display in which they engage, which appear not to be isolated, but instead direct responses to one another. More broadly, it suggests that the introduction of new agents into Roman politics during the fourth century is responsible for the rise in public displays. The model is also successfully applied to other examples of display centering on the figure of Q. Fabius Maximus Rullianus, one of the men consistently opposed to Appius. I also suggest that factional competition can be used to explain the location of various temples around Republican Rome, and that such competition may have great explanatory power for many observed displays throughout the Republic. The existence of factionally driven innovation and competition may also help explain the circumstances leading to the downfall of the Republic.","1998","2011-09-25 00:49:19","2016-11-25 23:10:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Michigan","United States -- Michigan","Eng","","","","","","0000","Ph.D.; University of Michigan","","; /Users/john_muccigrosso/Documents/Zotero data/storage/WW64U4TP/Muccigrosso - 1998 - Factional competition and monumental construction .pdf; /Users/john_muccigrosso/Documents/Zotero data/storage/FV7C7XVJ/Muccigrosso dissertation - John Muccigrosso.pdf","http://search.proquest.com/docview/304443512?accountid=10558","temples","","","","","Potter, David S.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Non si traita di un santuario dinastico, perché uno dei suoi dei tutelari, Marte, non fu mai considerato un antenato divino degli Iulii. Un indizio per la sua interpretazione viene dalla sua collocazione topografica. Assieme alla basilica di Nettuno (un memoriale aile vittorie navali di Agrippa, in particolare Actium) esso formava un complesso di due edifici simili che si aprivano su una piazza posta fra di loro. Le divinità di Actium erano Apollo, divinità personale di Augusto, e due esperti militari divini, Marte e Nettuno. Il pantheon di Agrippa avrebbe dovuto quindi essere dedicato a Marte e commemorare le vittorie terrestri dei suo fondatore. Ciò è corroborato dai Fasti Fratrum Arvalium del 23 settembre, che citano feste dedicate a: Marti, Neptuno in Campo, Apollini e theatrum Marcelli. I tempii di Marte e Nettuno in Campo, fondati sotto Augusto nella zona delle attività costruttive di Agrippa e dedicati ad Augusto nel giorno del suo compleanno insieme al tempio di Apollo, erano sicuramente memoriali per Actium. Poichè la Basilica di Nettuno viene anche riferita come τò ποσεıώνıον, il che rende inevitabile la sua identificazione con il tempio di Nettuno in Campo, il Pantheon di Agrippa avrebbe dovuto essere il tempio di Marte in Campo. Questi tempii, costruiti su terreni privati ed assenti dal calendario uíficiale, costituivano sacra privata. Ciò facilitò la loro reinterpretazione, nel successivo periodo dei Giulio-Claudii, discendenti di Marco Antonio, rispettivamente di mal definito pantheion (non una aedes publica, poichè le iscrizioni conservate da Adriano non citano alcuna divinità) e di basilica.","1994","2016-08-15 20:50:49","2016-10-19 02:14:45","2016-08-15 20:50:49","261-277","","","62","","PBSR","Was Agrippa's Pantheon the Temple of Mars ""In Campo?","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","00008","","/Users/john_muccigrosso/Documents/Zotero data/storage/H3APN4CX/Ziolkowski - 1994 - Was Agrippa's Pantheon the Temple of Mars In Camp.pdf","","temples","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet it was an important building, originally founded as a victory monument by M. Fulvius Nobilior, the conqueror of Aetolia and friend of Ennius, and rebuilt with great splendor by L. Marcius Philippus, Augustus's step-father. It appears on the Severan Forma Urbis Romae with only small and unimportant lacunae, and the main problem must be interpretation of this plan in the light of the testimonia. Examination of the sources suggests Fulvius Nobilior's temple was to the Muses alone and may not have been architecturally significant; all that we really know is that it contained a set of statues of the nine Muses and a small bronze aedicula ascribed to the time of Numa. Philip's rebuilding, on the other hand, made it a major temple of surprising subtlety and complexity, with focus both forward and back. The cult of Hercules Musarum, which Philip probably grafted on to the old cult of the Muses, may have been the invention of Q. Pomponius Musa some forty years earlier.","1977","2016-10-15 21:26:01","2016-10-19 02:15:32","2016-10-15 21:26:01","355-361","","3","81","","AJA","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","00022","","/Users/john_muccigrosso/Documents/Zotero data/storage/6AARUZJF/Richardson - 1977 - Hercules Musarum and the Porticus Philippi in Rome.pdf","","temples","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dinsmoor Jr. in the 1960s, was the first monumental peripteral temple in Attica. Based on our fieldwork, we argue construction began as part of the Athenian response to the Battle of Marathon. The temple is notable for its early use of the 6 × 13 plan that would become so distinctive in Attic architecture. The location of Sounion as the outer gateway to the harbors of Athens and the access point for communication with the broader Aegean meant that the deme (and its cult of Poseidon) became ever more significant when the Athenian navy was expanded as part of the defense of Attica.","2016","2016-11-19 22:40:46","2016-11-19 22:41:04","2016-11-19 22:40:46","657-710","","4","85","","Hesp","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","","/Users/john_muccigrosso/Documents/Zotero data/storage/PPAGWJCN/Paga and Miles - 2016 - The Archaic Temple of Poseidon at Sounion.pdf","","temples","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
